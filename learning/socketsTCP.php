 * Domain -> The domain parameter specifies the protocol family to be used by the socket.
 * AF_INET	IPv4 Internet based protocols. TCP and UDP are common protocols of this protocol family.
 * AF_INET6	IPv6 Internet based protocols. TCP and UDP are common protocols of this protocol family.
 * AF_UNIX	Local communication protocol family. High efficiency and low overhead make it a great form of IPC (Interprocess Communication).
 * Type -> The type parameter selects the type of communication to be used by the socket.
 * SOCK_STREAM	Provides sequenced, reliable, full-duplex, connection-based byte streams. An out-of-band data transmission mechanism may be supported. The TCP protocol is based on this socket type.
 * SOCK_DGRAM	Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed maximum length). The UDP protocol is based on this socket type.
 * SOCK_SEQPACKET	Provides a sequenced, reliable, two-way connection-based data transmission path for datagrams of fixed maximum length; a consumer is required to read an entire packet with each read call.
 * SOCK_RAW	Provides raw network protocol access. This special type of socket can be used to manually construct any type of protocol. A common use for this socket type is to perform ICMP requests (like ping).
 * SOCK_RDM	Provides a reliable datagram layer that does not guarantee ordering. This is most likely not implemented on your operating system.
 * Protocol -> The protocol parameter sets the specific protocol within the specified domain to be used when communicating on the returned socket. The proper value can be retrieved by name by using getprotobyname(). If the desired protocol is TCP, or UDP the corresponding constants SOL_TCP, and SOL_UDP can also be used.
 *
 * Socket errors
 * using two methods  socket_last_error(). This error code may be passed to socket_strerror(socket_last_error())
 *
 * Sockets are blocking by default. These can be turned to non-blocking by using socket_set_blocking() or socket_set_nonblock(). When in non-blocking mode methods which are supposed to wait until they receive data return right away without waiting.
 * socket_set_blocking is an alias of stream_set_blocking which can be used to set any stream in non blocking mode by passing true or false as argument.
 * All the methods such as socket_accept and socket_change which actually wait for things to happen work that way only in blocking mode and not in non blocking mode.

 * Parameters Â¶

socket
A valid socket resource created with socket_create() or socket_accept().

length
The maximum number of bytes read is specified by the length parameter. Otherwise you can use \r, \n, or \0 to end reading (depending on the type parameter, see below).

type
Optional type parameter is a named constant:

PHP_BINARY_READ (Default) - use the system recv() function. Safe for reading binary data.
PHP_NORMAL_READ - reading stops at \n or \r.

If socket has been made non-blocking using socket_set_blocking() or socket_set_nonblock(), FALSE will be returned.

/**
 * To handle every connection we need a separate handling code to run along with the main server accepting connections. One way to achieve this is using threads. The main server program accepts a connection and creates a new thread to handle communication for the connection, and then the server goes back to accept more connections.
However php does not support threading directly.

Another method is to use the select function. The select function basically 'polls' or observers a set of sockets for certain events like if its readable, or writable or had a problem or not etc.
So the select function can be used to monitor multiple clients and check which client has send a message.
