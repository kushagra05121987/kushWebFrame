##Excluded components

##How to build

Bootsharp requires NPM to run tasks.

 - `npm run build` compiles docs to optimized static files
 - `npm run dist` compiles docs to optimized static files and starts server
 - `npm start` compiles docs, starts server, watches for changes

 As an alternative, you can load `_variables.scss` and `_bootsharp.scss` into a bootstrap loader.
